Usage:
    make-client-tarball --bundle=lscsoft-all -a --version=1.0
will make the tarball for @lscsoft-all.

Should be done on an el6+ x86_64 box.

Took about 15 minutes last time I ran it.

Add patches to a 'patches/ligo' directory.  Patches are applied with -p1 to the
root dir of the tarball.  Other fixes should be put into stage2.py.  Changes to
the environment scripts (setup.sh) should be made in envsetup.py.

"Stage 1" packages are packages that are installed into the tarball directory
as it is being built, but are excluded from the final tarball.  These are
libraries and programs that everybody should already have on their system, e.g.
bash.  Edit ligo-stage1.lst to add or remove packages from the stage 1 list.

"Stage 2" packages are packages that make up the software in the tarball.
Edit the 'packages' lines in bundles.ini to define the list of stage 2
packages.  yum group names are preceded by '@', e.g. '@lscsoft-all'.

A bundle is defined in bundles.ini and consists of the packages, patches, etc.
that make up a kind of tarball, e.g. osg-wn-client-3.2 or lscsoft-all.
