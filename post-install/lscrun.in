# lscrun is a utility script for the tarball client. It allows you to run a
# single command using the LSC environment. Users should copy or symlink this
# into $HOME/bin or some location in their $PATH that they have control over.
#
# Example use:
#
# lscrun grid-proxy-init
# lscrun globus-job-run localhost /usr/bin/id
#
# You can also launch a shell, for example:
# lscrun /bin/bash
# The shell will then have the LSC environment inside.
