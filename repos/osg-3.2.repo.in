# prerelease needs to have better priority than release-build to
# properly handle the edge case where release-build has a package of
# higher version than prerelease This popped up during the switch to
# 3.2, when the release repos for 3.2 were empty so release-build was
# filled with EPEL packages instead -- some of which were higher
# version than what was in prerelease.
